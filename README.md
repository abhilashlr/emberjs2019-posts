These don't have blog posts but it felt like they should be tracked somehow.
1. "I hope query params get some love in #EmberJS2019. Biggest pain point of the framework right now imo. At least as development goes." - [Robert Clancy](https://twitter.com/robboclancy/status/1133411097279696902)
1. "Here is my @emberjs blog post for #EmberJS2019 (in a tweet)! I start from the idea that 80% of apps don't need a full SPA to sprinkle in some client side niceties. What do I need from my tool belt?" - [Scott Newcomer](https://twitter.com/puekey/status/1135693033729454080)
